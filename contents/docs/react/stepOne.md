  Lets set up a basic React app
</h1>

# First thing

Lets go ahead and find a new place to put our projects. I have mine in a projects directory (folder). When you have decided where the project is going to go. Open up the terminal and navigate to that directory. Once inside run the command `npx create-react-app <PICK_NAME>`. Sub out the <PICK_NAME> with whatever your app name will be. I will use liftoff so I will run `npx create-react-app liftoff`

Once that has finished you should now be able to a `ls` in your terminal and see the new folder, `cd` into it.

Run the command `npm run start` If this was a repo we had cloned we would need to do a `npm install` first to get all the packages to be able to run it. Npm is a part of node that allows us to grab dependencies.

You should see a React logo if you go to `http://localhost:3000`
