# Last Little Bit 🤯

#### Ok we made it here and if you have hated it so far well...

Sorry about it 🤪

## Alright lets get the rest together so you can get to coding and make this \*\*\* project✊

Lets now create a directory called pages in the src folder

Create the following files in the pages directory

page1.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return <di>Page 1</di>
}
```

page2.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return <di>Page 2</di>
}
```

page3.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return <di>Page 3</di>
}
```

page4.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return <di>Page 4</di>
}
```

Not much to talk about here we are making four components that are calling pages that are going to be four different views in our app. These are blank on purpose so you can add your own things.

### Ok sweet 🍭

Now lets run npm run start and fire this bad boy up 🚀

You should see the pages and be able to navigate as well at localhost:3000

If you are stuck

here is a link to the repo

### Also bonus install prettier

`npm i prettier -g`

now create this file at the same level as the package.json

```
{
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "semi": false,
    "singleQuote": true
}
```

This will give you formatting when you save !!!!! How freaking sweet! Side note 👽🧨🎨 Area 51 anyone 😉?

Also, we grabbed axios use this to make your http request to the java spring boot service. I didn't give examples of that on purpose to teach you to learn how to google things. Good Luck that will connect your front end to the back end.

## Now to the JAVA ☕️
