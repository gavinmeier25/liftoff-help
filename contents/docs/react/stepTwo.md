# Lets get some dependencies 🧐

Npm makes it easy for us to use other peoples code in our project which is sweet and nice. We are doing it already by running the React app.😬

We are going to grab them all at once because its easy but we will go over each one briefly and then

```npm install react-router-dom @material-ui/core axios

```
